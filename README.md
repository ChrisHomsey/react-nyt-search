# react-nyt-search

This was a simple app built to allow the user to search articles from the New York Times and save their favorite articles. 

NYT Search was also built on a **MERN Stack - using MongoDB, Express, ReactJS, and NodeJS**. It used the **New York Times API** to grab the articles based on the user's criteria. The front end was built with **React Web JSX**, which is excellent for creating reusable components, such as the search results and saved articles.
